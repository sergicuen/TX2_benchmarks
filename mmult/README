To compÃ¬le:

$ make

Makefile assumes that nvcc is located in /usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc

Usage:

$ bin/mat_mul_redundant -s SIZE -x threads_per_block_x -y threads_per_block_y -b replicate_input

MATRIX SIZE = SIZE * SIZE
replicate_input = 1 -> YES, 0 -> NO

E.g. Matrix of 1024*1024 and block size 32*32 with replicated input:

$ bin/mat_mul_redundant -s 1024 -x 32 -y 32 -b 1
